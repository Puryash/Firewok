    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Here at Burger Site, we're passionate about burgers. Our founder, Waqar, grew up in a small town where there was only one burger. He dreamed of creating a restaurant that offered a wide variety of burgers.</p>
    <p>After years of perfecting his recipes and finding the right team, Burger Site was born. Today, we're proud to serve our community with the best burgers around.</p>
